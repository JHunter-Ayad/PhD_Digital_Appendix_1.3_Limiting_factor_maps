# PhD_Digital_Appendix_1.3_Limiting_factor_maps
Digital appendix materials from my PhD Thesis at the University of Otago

This repository is the third digital appendix created to suplement my PhD thesis "Resources to Aid Decision-Making in Conservation Translocations" submitted to the University of Otago in November 2021.

As these digital appendices are not intended to be stand alone, I intend to upload a pdf file of my thesis once it is accepted and finalised to provide further context for the repository content.

This third appendix provides further details of the limiting factor analyses conducted to suplement the correlative habitat suitability model replicates that were averaged to generate the models presented in Chapter 4 of my thesis "Predictive Modelling: Relict Distribution Habitat Models". The final results of these limmiting factor analyses are presented in physical Appendix A.6 of my thesis.

The repository is split into two folders, containing replicates of conservative and extrapolative model replicates respectively (more details of the concepts behind these model categories are presented in the paper linked here: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcosc.2021.691714/full, with further methodological details contianed in the suplementary materials of this paper). 

The conservative model and extrapolative model folders each contain several .asc files that contain raster maps outputs of the limiting factor analysis outputs for each of my 40 identified optimal model replicates, one file for the analysis when conducted for model projections to Kahurangi National Park and one file for the analysis when conducted for model projections to Te Anau Ecoregion.

The appendix also contains an .asc file for each projection containing the "average" limiting map, though limitations to the method used are stated in physical appendix A.6.

Further to this a set of three .tiff files are inluded for each projection extent, containing plots of the .asc files included in the appendix for quick viewing and comparison.
